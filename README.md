# Conductor Java SDK 3 (WIP)

## TODO
- Review and improve examples
- Fix tests to keep client & SDK tests properly separated
- Remove archaius
- Review all dependendencies
- Publish client and sdk to Maven
- Add back documentation (after reviewing)
- Too many unimplemented methods
- Not enough testing
- Create module for Spring
- Create module for Netflix extensions (this might need further changes in several places)
